# Smart Content Moderator
Toxic and harmful comments on online video platforms, especially YouTube, create an unsafe digital space for viewers and content creators. Manual moderation is inefficient, especially for channels with high engagement. There is a need for an automated system that can help creators moderate comments intelligently without investing significant time or effort.
This project Smart Content Moderator aims to classify Toxic comments (using Random Forest Machine learning algorithm) from under users Youtube video and delete them for positive environment for both user and young viewers.
